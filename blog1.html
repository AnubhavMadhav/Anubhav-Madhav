                <p style="color: white;">Welcome to the world of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
                <p>This is my first blog, and I am writing this blog on behalf of my experience yet in Computer Science and Engineering. I will be sharing some tips and facts which almost every Computer Science Engineer should know, before you start it all.
                </p>
                <p>I am Anubhav Madhav, sophomore(2nd year undergrad), Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara. </p>
                <br>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <h4 style="color: white;">CSE v/s CE</h4>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>CE - Computer Engineering, is mostly focussed on the Hardware side of Computer.</p>
                <p>Whereas,
                </p>
                <p>CSE - Computer Science and Engineering, deals with the software part. Though, both S/W and H/W are taught in both branches.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4 style="color: white;">Types of Students</h4>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, there are all kinds of people everywhere in the world, you need to learn to deal with each and everyone, else just ignore them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various types of Students in an Engineering College:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I want a job after B.Tech
                    </li>
                    <li>I want to pursue M.Tech. from IIT (or Abroad)
                    </li>
                    <li>I want to pursue MBA from IIM</li>
                    <li>I want to clear UPSC Exam and serve the nation as IAS/IPS</li>
                    <li>I am here just for a degree, I’ll continue my Father’s Business</li>
                    <li>I don’t care about my life (Ehhh….)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Now, let’s talk only about the ones who really want a good career in CSE. Here are some tips for you.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Computer Science and Engineering can be simplified as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintaining a decent CPI (>7.5)
                    </li>
                    <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                    <li>Competitive Programming</li>
                    <li>Development</li>
                    <li>Research</li>
                    <li>Open Source Contribution</li>
                    <li>An Impressive profile</li>
                    <li>Management and Leadership Skills</li>
                    <li>Communities, Groups and Clubs</li>
                    <li>Campus Ambassador Roles</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Maintaining a Decent CPI (>7.5)</h3>
                <p>It is a must to maintain a good CPI, at least before you sit for your interview. It will be OK if you maintain a CPI in the range of [7 to 9]. No need to hustle hard for a CPI>9. Because, if you’ll strive for an outstanding CPI, you won’t
                    be able to make time to learn new things.
                </p>
                <p>In your University or Institutes, they focus more on the basic course and their depths. Many of them won’t teach you to make an Android App. But, will surely teach you some core subjects which will help you in Android Development. That’s
                    why, don’t make too much time only for the Institute’s Courses.</p>
                <p>Do not let your CPI go below 7, because most of the companies allow only students with CPI>7 to sit in their Interviews. Though, few good companies do not even have a Criteria for CPI.</p>
                <p>Still, to be on the safe side, it’s good to have a CPI>7.5.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
                <p>These are the most important courses in CSE. Some Institutes teach them separately and some teach DS and Algo together.</p>
                <p>DS and Algorithms will help you in Competitive Programming and in Development as well.</p>
                <p>Whatever the condition or situation be, you need to study these courses thoroughly. Once, you get a good grab over it, you are ready to rock in the upcoming years.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Competitive Programming</h3>
                <p>This is also a very important thing which almost every CSE Student must practice daily(though I haven’t started seriously yet, will do). This is really a very important part because when you will sit for an interview at the time of your
                    placement or internship, the interview will be held in rounds and the 1st round is always the Competitive Programming Round.</p>
                <p>All you need to start with it is, just start with any programming language you want. C++ is preferred the most, you can use Java too. Don’t worry, if you are new to programming languages, you can learn them online from websites like Udemy,
                    Coursera, edX, Udacity and yes, YouTube etc. and then you can practice them on websites like HackereRank, Codeforces and Coding Ninjas etc. These were some good websites to start with. Practice Data Structures and Algorithms regularly.
                    Once you get a good knowledge of programming languages, it’s time to get your hands dirty in Competitive Programming, popularly known as CP.</p>
                <p>Some good websites to start with Competitive Programming are CodeChef, HackerEarth and TopCoder etc. Once you get familiar with it, you should try LeetCode, because most of the big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft etc.
                    ask questions which are similar to that on LeetCode.</p>
                <p>Make a habit to solve at least one question per day.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Development</h3>
                <p>This is the most interesting side of CSE. Here, you develop beautiful apps and websites and many more.</p>
                <p>It can be divided into following parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <li>Android Development</li>
                    <li>iOS Development</li>
                    <li>Blockchain</li>
                    <li>Cloud Computing</li>
                    <p>And many more……</p>
                </ol>
                <p>From here, you should study in brief about all of them, and see whether you are interested in development or not, and if you are then in which major. Choose your kit and master onto it. Having such skills is too much beneficiary.
                </p>
                <p>“Data Science” is the most emerging field nowadays.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Research</h3>
                <p>This is the “scientist: side of CSE. Here you do a lot of analysis and research and then finally you write some Research Papers, maybe on Algorithms, Machine Learning, Deep Learning or AI.</p>
                <p>Such people apparently go for M.Tech and then PhD in their preferred field of CSE.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Open Source Contribution</h3>
                <p>You might have heard about “Google Summer of Code” or ‘GSoC’. Well, this is a competition which goes on throughout the summers, and what you do here is contribute to your Open Source Organization.</p>
                <p>Open Source Contribution is when many developers around the world contribute to some organization and help them in their projects. To make it much easier, we have a website called GitHub.</p>
                <p>You can make your own projects and repositories on GitHub and upload your piece of code there. You can also contribute to projects of some organizations like FOSSASIA etc., who have their code over there on GitHub.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">An Impressive Profile</h3>
                <p>Well, this is not compulsory, but having a good profile will surely boost your chances to get a good career in CS. Maintain all your social media profiles well, just do not waste much time on Instagram or Snapchat.
                </p>
                <p>LinkedIn, the most important one, you should have an excellent LinkedIn Profile, mine is not excellent yet, but I am trying to. Keep your LinkedIn profile “All-star”. You will get it, what “All-Star” means here, once you will create your
                    profile over there. You can refer to mine here, if you want to.</p>
                <p>Create a personal website of your own, create your portfolio and build an Awesome Resume. Keep updating them.</p>
                <p>It’ll be very good if you write blogs, as I am doing right now.</p>
                <p>Stay Updated. Keep Updated.</p>

                <br><br>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Management and Leadership Skills</h3>
                <p>No matter how good your coding is, you should focus on your personality development too. Learn to manage events, competitions and projects. Bring out the leader within you.</p>
                <p>These skills will help you everywhere in your life. And may help you get a job at a better position too.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 style="color: white;">Communities, Groups and Clubs</h3>
                <p>Join communities, clubs and groups or create one of yours. Learn to be a part of the community, join their chat channels on Slack, Gitter or Google Groups.
                </p>
                <p>Join clubs like Developer Student Clubs, or create one of yours if your University doesn’t have one.</p>
                <p>Take part in Google Developer Groups DevFest or AppFest of your city or state, and even join their community as a member if you feel like. You can also join or host CodeChef Campus Chapter at your Campus.</p>

                <br><br>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Campus Ambassador Roles</h3>

                <p>It is great to represent your campus in certain organizations or in some competitions, whether it be as a participant or as a Campus Ambassador.</p>

                <p>I have played various roles like Campus Ambassador at Awign, Campus Evangelist of HackerEarth at Codathon’20 CHIMERA, MANIT Bhopal.</p>

                <p>These roles help you to gain some good contact or referrals, and even tell you about how good your network is. I like playing such roles, and have excelled in each one of them because I have a very good network and impact on my Campus,
                    as well as outside the campus. I am sure this will benefit me a lot.</p>

                <br><br>
